    <h2> All About Me </h2>
    <p> I am Angel Mae Selen Salazar, Born on the 16th of May in 2007. My parents, Hilda Selen Salazar 
        (Mother) and Edwin Ramillano Salazar (Father) came from Zambonga City. So, I am currently living 
        in Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay on my grandmother's house along with my two siblings Lucky Ehhrss Selen 
        Salazar (Eldest) and My older Sister Edda May Salazar. My aunt, Rosda Rafael Selen is alaso living 
        with us in our grandmother's house. Although my parents already lives here, we still often visit 
        our old house in Zamboanga City because my other aunt, uncle, and cousins still lives there.

    <p> My hobbies used to be cycling, reading science books, watching series like Blackmirror, and cooking 
        meals. My favorite color is Purple or Lilac because it is very appealing to my eyes. So, I try to 
        collect purple or lilac colored things as much as I can. Now, I am still doing some of my hobbies 
        whenever I am free, but I am mostly spending my time sleeping at home because I get really tired
        easily even without being productive. For this same reason, I struggle to sleep and I am always 
        up at night.     
    </p>
    
    <p> At a young age I was fascinated with Science, so upon growing up I have sorrounded my self with 
        like minded people. Me and my childhood friends spent our free time reading and discussing about 
        what we have read in our Science books. That's why I used to want to be a Scientist. I did take 
        a Computer Science  Course because it is the closes I can get to being a Scientist. Along with 
        that, I had a hobby of always Cycling in the early morning with my friends. Now, I still like 
        cycling but I dont have enough time to do so. Instead, I spend my summer days going to the beach 
        because my parents has summer vacation for their jobs.
