<h1> AM's Recipe for Egg Drop Soup </h1>
<h2> Ingredients List: </h2>
<ul>  
    <li> 3/4 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li> 1/8 teaspoon sugar </li>
    <li> 1 scallion (chopped) </li>
    <li> 3 eggs (lightly beaten) </li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil </li>
    <li> 1/8 teaspoon white pepper </li>
    <li> 3 tablespoons cornstarch (mixed 
         with 1/3 cup water) </li>
    <li> 1/4 teaspoon MSG (increase amount 
         to personal preference) </li>
    <li> 4 cups chicken stock (about 1 liter, 
         organic or homemade preferred!) </li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon turmeric (Or 5 drops 
         yellow food coloring. Optional) </li>
</ul>

<h2> Materials Needed: </h2>
<ul> 
    <li> Whisk or fork. </li>
    <li> Ladle or spoon </li> 
    <li> Medium-sized pot or saucepan </li>
    <li> Small bowl (for mixing the cornstarch slurry) </li>
    <li> Small bowl or measuring cup (for beating eggs) </li>
    
</ul>
<h2> Procedure: </h2>
<ol> 
    <li> 
         Bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in 
         the sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, and MSG (if using). </li>        
    <li> 
         Add in the turmeric or 5 drops of yellow food coloring, if using. 
         This will give the soup that rich restaurant-style yellow color, 
         but it is optional. </li>
    <li> Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if needed.   </li>
    <li>
         Next add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch 
         and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. </li>
    <li> Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you'll 
         get clumps of cooked starch in your soup. </li> 
    <li> Use more or less starch if you like a thicker or thinner soup. </li>  
    <li> You can also add the starch in a couple small batches, let the soup 
         simmer for a couple of minutes, then check to see if the consistency 
         is to your liking. </li>
    <li> 
         Now we're ready for the most exciting part: the egg. This recipe calls 
         for the egg to be lightly beaten, which results in both white and yellow 
         egg swirls. </li>
    <li> The speed at which you stir the soup when adding the egg also determines 
         whether you get large “egg flowers” or small egg flowers (i.e. swirly 
         bits of egg). </li>
    <li> Use a ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion, and slowly drizzle in 
         the egg until you have added it all. </li>
    <li> 
         Ladle the soup into bowls, top with scallions, and serve!  </li>
</ol>
