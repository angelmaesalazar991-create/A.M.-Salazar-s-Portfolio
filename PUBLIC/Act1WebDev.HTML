     <h1> HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE (HTML)</h1>
     <h2> Is responsible of the content of the Website</h2>

     <p> First paragraph. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and
     structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for webpages by defining elements
     like headings, paragraphs, link, images, and multimedia. HTML uses a sytem of tags and attributes to
     mark up content, enabling browsers to interpret and render it visually for users. For example, the p
     tag defines a paragraph, while the a tag creates hyper-links, making HTML the backbone of web
     navigation and content presentation. HTML is a foundation technology of the web and works seamlessly
     with CSS (Cascading style sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. It is designed to be
     both human-readable and machine-interpretable, allowing developers to build structured documents.
     With advancements like HTML5, the language has incorporated support for rich media, such as video,
     and interactive elements, without requiring addtional plugins. This has made HTML more versatile
     and integral to modern web development.</p>

     <h1> CASCADING STYLE SHEET (CSS)</h1>
     <h2> Is responsible of the style of the website</h2>

     <p> Second paragraph. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used to describe
     the visual presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML. CSS allows developers
     to separate content from design by specifying styles such as colors, fonts, layout, and spacing. This
     separation enables more efficient and consistent design management, as changes to sytles can be made
     in one place and applied across multiple pages or elements. CSS operates in a cascading manner, 
     meaning that style can be layered and prioritized based on the rules of inheritance and specificity,
     giving developers fine-grained control over the appearance of web content. CSS is an essential part of
     modern web development because it enhances the user experience by making web pages visually appealing
     and interactive. It supports responsive design, enabling websites to adapt seamlessly to different 
     devices and screen sizes. Addtionally, CSS can be applied inline (within HTML elements), internally
     (in the style tag), or xternally (via linked. css files), with external stylesheets being the most 
     common and scalable approach. Advanced features of CSS, such animations, transitions, and grid or
     flexbox layouts, allows developers to create dynamic and sophisticated web designs without relying
     heavily on javascript. <p>

     <h1> JAVASCRIPT (JS)</h1>
     <h2> Is responsible of the functionality of the website</h2>

     <p> JavaScript is a website and widely-used programming language primarily design for creating
     interactive and dynamic web applications. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
     HTML and CSS, enabling developers to build responsive user interfaces and add interactive features 
     such as animations, form validations, and real-time updates. JavaScript is excuted in web browsers,
     allowing it to modify the content and behavior of web pages without needing to reload them. This 
     client-side capability has made it indispensable for modern web development. Beyond the browser, 
     JavaScript has expanded its reach with platforms like Node.js, which allows developers to write
     server-side code. This versability has transformed JavaScript into a full-stack language capable 
     of handling both front-end and back-end development. Addtionally, it supports numerous frameworks 
     and libraries such as React, Angular and Vue.js, which streamline the development process and help
     create feature-rich applications. Its ability to work across platforms and its continuous evaluation
     have made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages in the world.<p>
